MotoSim EG-VRC (Enhanced Graphics Virtual Robot Controller) is a software package that allows you to create and simulate a robotic workcell offline, without the need for a physical robot or controller. You can use MotoSim EG-VRC to optimize robot and equipment placement, perform reach modeling, calculate accurate cycle times, generate automatic paths, detect collisions, configure system settings, edit condition files, and access the virtual robot controller function.
 
The virtual robot controller function is one of the most distinctive features of MotoSim EG-VRC. It enables you to operate and display a programming pendant interface identical to the real controller. The virtual robot controller completely simulates the Motoman Â® robot controller software, so you can test and debug your programs before transferring them to the real robot. You can also remotely access the real robot controller from MotoSim EG-VRC, if you have a network connection.

If you want to learn more about MotoSim EG-VRC, you can watch a webinar that walks through the key features of the software, view a datasheet that summarizes its specifications, or watch some YouTube tutorials that demonstrate how to use it. You can also contact Yaskawa Motoman Robotics for more information or request a quote.
  
MotoSim EG-VRC is not only a simulation software, but also a robot programming simulator. You can use it to create and edit robot programs using the same language and commands as the real controller. You can also use the built-in MotoSize tool to select the proper robot model based on your load ratings and payload requirements. MotoSim EG-VRC allows you to program your robot in a virtual environment, without affecting the production or safety of your real workcell.
 
MotoSim EG-VRC is compatible with various CAD formats, such as STEP, IGES, STL, VRML, and DXF. You can import your CAD models into MotoSim EG-VRC and use them to create realistic simulations of your workcell. You can also export your MotoSim EG-VRC models to other software applications, such as MotoFit or MotoSolve, for further analysis and optimization. MotoSim EG-VRC enables you to integrate your robot with other devices and systems, such as vision sensors, grippers, conveyors, PLCs, and more.
 
MotoSim EG-VRC is a user-friendly and intuitive software that can be easily learned and used by anyone who has basic knowledge of robotics. You can customize your user interface according to your preferences and needs. You can also access online help and tutorials from within the software. MotoSim EG-VRC is a powerful tool that can help you design, program, and simulate your robotic workcell with ease and efficiency.
